### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback (links are nice)

[Caleb and Trent's PR](https://github.com/Caleb9193/brotha_nature_api/pull/3)
[Chris' PR](https://github.com/concach/ScoreKeeper/pull/1)

It was fun getting to look at other students' code and get to see what they were up to.  At some points it was tough to find things that I could comment on, but at other points I did learn a few things by reviewing their code.

### Discuss: your experience doing blog reviews and getting feedback (links are nice)

All of my blog comments are in the PR-Review channel.  It was cool to see what other people were up to.  Most of my comments were relatively minor suggestions.  Overall most people had very good blog posts.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

The stand ups were fine.  I felt that they should be a bit more brief than they ended up being.  It is nice to know what everyone is working on so I can see why they are the norm in the industry.
