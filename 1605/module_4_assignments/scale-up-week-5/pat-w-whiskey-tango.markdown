### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
Worked on a React container component that featured very heavy UI/UX functionality including:
- User can see a tag's exercises by clicking that tag.
- User can have multiple tags active at once.
- User can click 'Clear Tags' to render no tags active.
- User can click on an individual exercise to launch a modal on that exercise.
- User can paginate through individual exercise details
- URL's change dynamically according to which modal is rendered and
  which tab the user is currently on.
- User can add individual exercises to their workouts by dragging
  exercise links and dropping them into their exercises container.

Really enjoyed helping out those in my cohort with small React details that are easy to miss and also
loved that the mentors were so active with helping out as well. Very reassuring to know that some
things we're doing are indeed following React convention

### Discuss: your experience doing blog and getting feedback (links are nice)

I really didn't know what to write about my blog without it just being an opinion piece.
I just wrote an honest reaction to the problems I had to solve with Scale-Up last week.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Stand ups were nice because I got to hear what everybody else is working on. Part of me
wanted to pair with those that might have been struggling with React...but unfortunately I
didn't have the time these last two weeks.
