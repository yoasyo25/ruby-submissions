Meets Expectations. I could have done better here, but I did work to break things out into smaller parts and keep track on Waffle.

Meets Expectations. Again, could have been better, but I did talk with my lead throughout the project to let her know where I was and what my struggles were.

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.

- Above Expectations

Meets expectations. I feel like this one is hard. The code was all in a language I had never done before, and don't know the idiomatic use of. I feel like I did okay given that fact.

### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
