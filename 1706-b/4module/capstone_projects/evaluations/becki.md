_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

I spent a lot of time planning before I got started. I had an iteration map, schema, and wireframes. My git workflow was OK but could have been better. On the front end side, I used feature branches with good commits and merged them. I started doing this with the backend side, but once I had set my project up on heroku, I found that I usually just pushed to master since I was the only one working on the project and I had to change multiple addresses in my frontend to run my backend locally.

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).

**- Above Expectations**
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

I completed all the iterations I planned on completing. There are some small things that still need to be added. At one point I thought I was not going to be able to finish and let my TL know several days before the deadline.

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

There are some areas that need to be refactored, and I had to make some decisions in certain areas that are not the best quality to finish the iterations in time. There is very minimal testing. However I feel that my code is very well organized and that I followed best practices as I know them.

### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

**- Above Expectations**
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

100% of my project is done in a new language.

### 5. Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

I have documentation for both my front and backend repos that explains the app and how to set it up, as well as a link to ways to contribute. The backend docs contain endpoints.

### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
**- Below Expectations**

My app can not be tabbed through yet. I did try to fix this problem but was not able to find a solution. I did try to use semantic tags, and I paid a lot of attention to the colors I was using. I have also included alts for the images.
