## Rubric

## Notes:

Lovely JavaScript! Loved the division of responsibilities from file to file. I was very impressed with the consistent ES6 usage. You've got some inconsistencies with JS convention in your `wordWatchApiCalls` and `htmlHelper` classes (they're not CapitalCamelCased), though. It'd be worth going back to fix those.
