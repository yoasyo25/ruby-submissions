### 1. Completion:
  * At a minimum, developer completes challenges 1-3.

Above Expectations

Meets Expectations

*Below Expectations
didn't complete the assignment. 

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing
  * Developer has no functions that exceed 8 lines.
  * Developer uses `Array.prototype` functions over `for` loops where appropriate.
  * Developer deals with async API requests in a readable, coherent way.

Above Expectations

*Meets Expectations
My code was pretty dry. I could have broken down my API interactions into separate JS files, but didn't have time. 

Below Expectations

### 3. Events and DOM manipulation
  * Developer resgisters event listeners within `document.ready`.
  * Developer targets nodes/elements cleanly using 1 or 2 css selectors.
    * && without heavy use of traversing parents and/or children.

Above Expectations

*Meets Expectations
I target things that I want to. I changed some of the names in the HTML to target the button I wanted. I had event listeners for when a button was clicked. 

Below Expectations

### 4. JS conventions
  * Developer scopes variables appropriately.
  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.
  * Developer has consistent use or non-use of semicolons.
  * Developer has consistent use of function syntax.
    * ...or can speak to why inconsistencies were necessary.
  * Developer names variables using camelCase.
  * Developer names classes and constructor functions using CapitalizedCamelCased.

Above Expectations

*Meets Expectations
Used decent amount of ES6 syntax. Prefer to use const over var. I do not use semicolons. 
I don't think I used much fat arrow syntax. 
Used Camel Case properly.

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Completion:
  * At a minimum, developer completes challenges 1-3.

Above Expectations

Meets Expectations

**Below Expectations** - The first challenge is the only one out of the five presented that's complete. The developer worked through some of the second challenge, but did not complete it.

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing
  * Developer has no functions that exceed 8 lines.
  * Developer uses `Array.prototype` functions over `for` loops where appropriate.
  * Developer deals with async API requests in a readable, coherent way.

Above Expectations

Meets Expectations

**Below Expectations** - The developer has DOM manipulation, API interactions, and data processing mostly in the same function and file. The developer is creating a new `Word` object within the `Word` constructor which indicates that the functionality may need to move elsewhere. The developer is on the right track with breaking code into smaller functions, but because the code does not produce the requested functionality, the code quality here is moving in the right direction, but does not meet expectations.

### 3. Events and DOM manipulation
  * Developer resgisters event listeners within `document.ready`.
  * Developer targets nodes/elements cleanly using 1 or 2 css selectors.
    * && without heavy use of traversing parents and/or children.

Above Expectations

Meets Expectations

**Below Expectations** - The developer added a name to the button element to make it easier to select (the directions state not to manipulate the HTML). The developer doesn't have DOM manipulation or event binding that results in functionality. 

### 4. JS conventions
  * Developer scopes variables appropriately.
  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.
  * Developer has consistent use or non-use of semicolons.
  * Developer has consistent use of function syntax.
    * ...or can speak to why inconsistencies were necessary.
  * Developer names variables using camelCase.
  * Developer names classes and constructor functions using CapitalizedCamelCased.

Above Expectations

**Meets Expectations** - The developer follows JS conventions. The developer does mix function syntax (arrows vs function keyword).
