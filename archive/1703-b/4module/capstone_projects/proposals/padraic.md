### Project Template

### Machine Learning / Computer Vision

### Pitch

The main goal is to implement supervised learning machine learning techniques involving computer vision, specifically enabling a computer to recognize color via a camera and/or an array of sensors.

### Problem

Machines need sight to open up innumerable capabilities that will help people create more efficient and intelligent systems. This project should demonstrate a machine's ability to recognize inputs based on light, using standard machine learning algorithms such as gradient descent.

### Solution

Using classification algorithms the project will show how machines can "see" color, as well as determine the greatest intensity of light in a given field of vision.

### Target Audience

The project will be useful to those interested in leveraging a machine's ability to find the maximum intensity of light, such as solar companies.

### New Techniques

The project will use Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, as well as supporting libraries including matplotlib and numpy.

### Workflow

Pivotal Tracker.
