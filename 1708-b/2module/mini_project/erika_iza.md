### Option 4: Original Idea

That's right. You are creative and I believe in you. Feel free to pitch an original idea for the mini-project.

#### Must-Haves:

[x] Deploy to Heroku
[x] Authentication/Authorization
[x] One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
[] Styling

#### Approval

In order to have your project approved, send a slack message to your instructors with answers to the following questions:

[] What will a visitor be able to do?
[] What will a logged in user be able to do?
[] What will an admin be able to do?
[] What is a one-to-many relationship you will be using?
[] What is a many-to-many relationship you will be using?

#### Things to Consider

If you choose to do this option make sure you try to implement all the concepts we've touched over the last week. For example:

[x] TDD - model and feature tests
[x] CRUD
[x] 1-1 and 1-many relationships
[x] ReST-ful routes
[x] Well structured relational database design
[] Rails helpers
[x] Sessions, flashes and maybe cookies if you have a good use case for them.
[x] Authentication
[x] Authorization
