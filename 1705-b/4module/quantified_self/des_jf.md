## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Meets Expectations: We run into issues we didn't anticipate with trying to connect the backend and the pront end and deplying in production; it would take us a littl emore time to understand what is causing the issues and bugs that were not there yesterday.
