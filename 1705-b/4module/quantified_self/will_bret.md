## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.


- Meets Expectations
Everything works on localhost but we had seeding issues with Heroku on our backend and weird issues with our github front end like our delete buttons suddenly disappearing.  

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Meets Expectations
Basic readme. 

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Meets Expectations
Simple and resuable HTML tags and formatting.  

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Meets Expectations
Only used buttons.  Our colors are very contrasting for ease of viewing.  

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
We feel this is very abstrated and most of our effort was put into this.  

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
We spent a lot of time using git and making sure we were always leaving comments.  We never approved our own PRs.  The only time we pushed to master ourselves was for heroku troubleshooting.  

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Above Expectations
Tracker was our giding star.  

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Above Expectations
We get along great and were always talking about the project.
