Notes:  
Started Iter 4  
Tried using fixtures, but it caused problems with answers off, so switched back to data set  
Testing:
Talked through unit vs integration examples  
Testing individual components as broke out methods  
Talked about how much TDD helped them trace errors  
140 assertions  
98% coverage  
1108s to run  
Ruby & Style:  
map, find_all, some reduce
Talked about breaking things apart to appease Law of Demeter  
Could improve readability of variable names  i.e. ir for invoice_repository

### 4. Functional Expectations

*   2: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

*   4: Zero complaints
